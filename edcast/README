edcast-jack Readme
-------------------

This version of edcast allows you to hook into any jack output port
and broadcast the audio to an icecast or shoutcast server.

This version of edcast is all command-line oriented, and comes with
example config files for each of the encoding types supported (Ogg Vorbis,
LAME, AAC).  You will most likely need to take one of the example configs
(in the conf dir) and modify it to suit your needs.

Here is an example of how to use it with jack (http://jackit.sourceforge.net).

Step 1: 
 * startup jackd 

Step 2:
 * Feed a signal into jackd.  There are many applications you can use
   for this, if you like XMMS, try installing http://xmms-jack.sourceforge.net/

Step 3:
 * Start edcast specifying the appropriate output ports.  To get a list of
   the output ports, use jack_lsp.  If you use XMMS, you'll see something like :

    % jack_lsp
    alsa_pcm:capture_1
    alsa_pcm:capture_2
    alsa_pcm:playback_1
    alsa_pcm:playback_2
    bio2jack_0_32083:out_0
    bio2jack_0_32083:out_1

   In this case, the bio2jack_0_32083:out_0 and bio2jack_0_32083:out_1 are the 
   output ports from XMMS.  So you'd start edcast like :

    edcast -c edcast_OggVorbis.cfg bio2jack_0_32083:out_0 bio2jack_0_32083:out_1

   Use edcast -h for a usage.
